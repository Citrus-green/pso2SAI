# pso2 Show All Items
this is mod for pso2cc  
It can be used only in CC edition regardless of JP or NA.  
In most cases, it is recommended to use the following command.  

move <CC/data/win32> <CC/data/win32.bk>  
mklink /d <CC/data/win32> <Mainstream/data/win32>  
or  
win32 in mainstream copy to win32 in CC without overwrite.  

This is because CCs often do not contain data.  

Please run this application after starting CC and moving to the character create screen.
